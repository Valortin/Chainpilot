Below is a README.md file for the Chainpilot project, tailored to provide clear setup instructions, project details, and context for the Wavehack/Buildathon submission. It includes an overview, setup guide, and information about the app’s purpose and Nodit integration, while keeping the tone professional yet engaging to align with the Buildathon’s innovative spirit.
Chainpilot
Chainpilot is an AI-powered decentralized application (dApp) designed as an in-wallet assistant that answers user queries about wallet activity (e.g., "What's my highest gas fee in the past month?" or "Which token has been most profitable?") and suggests or automates smart contract interactions. Built for the Wavehack/Buildathon, Chainpilot leverages Nodit’s Blockchain Model Context Protocol (MCP), Web3 Data API, and Node API to deliver a seamless, multi-chain Web3 experience.
The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for a responsive, animated UI with a futuristic Web3 aesthetic. This README provides instructions to set up and run the project, with placeholders for future Nodit API integrations.
🚀 Features

    AI-Powered Assistant: Ask natural language questions about your wallet activity, powered by Nodit’s MCP for dynamic API interactions.
    Wallet Insights: Query historical data like gas fees, token transfers, and profitability using Nodit’s Web3 Data API.
    Automation: Suggest and automate smart contract interactions (e.g., token swaps) via Nodit’s Node API.
    Sleek UI: A dark-themed, responsive interface with neon accents and smooth animations using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
    Multi-Chain Support: Designed to work with Ethereum, XRPL, Aptos, and other chains supported by Nodit.

🎯 Wavehack/Buildathon Alignment
Chainpilot aligns with the Buildathon’s theme of AI + Automation by:

    Integrating Nodit’s MCP to enable an AI agent to dynamically query blockchain data.
    Using Nodit’s Web3 Data API for real-time wallet insights.
    Leveraging Nodit’s Node API for automated contract interactions.
    Delivering an engaging, animated UI that showcases Web3 innovation.

⚙️ Installation

    Clone the Repository:
    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chainpilot.git
    cd chainpilot

    Install Dependencies:
    bash

    npm install

    Set Up Tailwind CSS:
    Ensure tailwind.config.js and src/index.css are configured as follows:
    tailwind.config.js:
    javascript

    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    module.exports = {
      content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
      theme: { extend: {} },
      plugins: [],
    }

    src/index.css:
    css

    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    body {
      margin: 0;
      font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
      background-color: #1a202c;
      color: #e2e8f0;
    }

    Run the Development Server:
    bash

    npm start

    Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

🎨 UI Features

    Navbar: Slides in with a branded “Chainpilot” logo and tagline.
    Chat Window: Displays user queries and AI responses with fade-in animations.
    Input Box: A sleek, animated input field for natural language queries.
    Theme: Dark mode with cyan accents, inspired by Web3 aesthetics.

🔗 Nodit Integration (Planned)
Chainpilot will integrate Nodit’s features for full functionality:

    Nodit MCP:
        Set up the MCP server to enable AI-driven API calls:
        json

        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "nodit": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": ["@noditlabs/nodit-mcp-server@latest"],
              "env": { "NODIT_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY" }
            }
          }
        }

        Clone and run the MCP server:
        bash

        git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/noditlabs/nodit-mcp-server.git
        cd nodit-mcp-server
        npm install
        npm run start

    Web3 Data API:
        Query wallet data (e.g., token transfers):
        bash

        curl --request POST \
          --url https://web3.nodit.io/v1/ethereum/mainnet/token/getTokenTransfersByAccount \
          --header 'X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY' \
          --data '{"accountAddress": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045", "fromDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "toDate": "2025-01-31T00:00:00+00:00"}'

    Node API:
        Trigger smart contract interactions (e.g., token swaps) via JSON-RPC calls.

🚧 Future Enhancements

    AI Integration: Connect to an LLM (e.g., Claude) via Nodit MCP for real-time query processing.
    Wallet Integration: Add MetaMask for user authentication and transaction signing.
    Analytics Dashboard: Visualize wallet data (e.g., gas fee charts) using Chart.js.
    Advanced Animations: Add wave-like animations to enhance the Buildathon’s “Wavehack” theme.
